# Terminal Buttons

Adds buttons to the right hand side of the statusbar to run the Rename terminal command and the Show Terminal command.

Rename Terminal is only visible if terminals can be seen. If you close the terminals, there is no GUI way of showing the terminals view again - only the command to focus on the terminal view via the comman palette.

It is not possible with extensions to change the window menus so this extension will add a button to the status bar to show the terminal view.
